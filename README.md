## Introduction

Customer churn, or attrition, is a significant concern for telecommunication companies. Identifying customers who are likely to churn can help companies take proactive measures to retain them. In this project, we aim to develop machine learning models that predict customer churn based on historical telecommunication data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

- Customer demographics
- Service usage
- Customer interaction
- Churn indicator

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure and relationships between variables.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features that contribute to predicting churn.
- **Model Selection**: Evaluating and comparing different machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using various evaluation metrics.
- **Visualizations**: Visualizing data distributions, feature importance, and model performance metrics.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
3. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
4. Execute the notebooks in the specified order (`EDA.ipynb`, `Preprocessing.ipynb`, etc.).

## Results

- Detailed analysis and performance metrics of each evaluated model.
- Visualizations illustrating key findings from the exploratory data analysis and feature selection process.
- Recommendations for telecommunication companies to mitigate customer churn.

## Future Work

- Experiment with advanced feature engineering techniques.
- Explore ensemble methods for model improvement.
- Incorporate additional external datasets for richer insights.
- Deploy the final model as a predictive service for real-time churn prediction.
